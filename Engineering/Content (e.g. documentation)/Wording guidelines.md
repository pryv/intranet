# Wording guidelines


## Pryv

- OK: "Pryv", "...on Pryv", "...on your pryv", "to pryv {something}", ...
- Not OK: "PrYv"


## Events

- **Don't use "event"**; it must remain a technical word used when describing Pryv's inner workings (e.g. in developer documentation)
- To describe events of a certain type, use the word for that type: **notes, pictures, positions, (numerical) values, etc.**
- To describe events of mixed or undetermined type, use **"content"** for uncountable cases and **"item(s)"** for countable cases


## Miscellaneous actions

- Register / sign in:
    - Opening a new user account is **"registering"** (not "signing up")
    - Authenticating as an existing user is **"signing in"** (not "logging in"); terminating a session is **"signing out"**
- Putting content in the trash is **"deleting"** (not "trashing")
