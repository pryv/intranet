# Design documents

A record of the many design explorations and decisions we make for Pryv.io.
Please stick to file structure `Title (YYYY-MM[-DD])/README.md`.

⚠️ Some drafts & early-concept design docs are found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14aytTn8rR2JA41esl5P5-5UtU86cGSFO). By the time we actually commit to designing something for implementation, design documents must be moved here.
