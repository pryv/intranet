## config

### 1. Initialization

1. Edit `platform.conf`
2. Add leader URL in followers
3. Generate leader-follower symmetric keys
4. Deploy configs on machines
   - Leader has his own
   - There are different followers if they are separate machines or not
5. *later* generate SSL certs on leader
6. Start Leader
7. Boot followers
8. Followers fetch their config
9. how do we identify followers? they signal "hey I'm here" instead of fetching it, but how 



### 2. Version update

1. POST leader**/versions/update** (improve path name)

   - body contains template version

2. leader fetches current version and compares it with local files to check that templates were not modified by hand

3. Aborts if differences

   - Write diff, timestamp and error message in logs

   - don't abort when using --force

4. Otherwise, downloads new version and overwrites files

   - Does he delete old files?

5. We should notify in the API response if there are platform parameter changes



### 3. Parameters update

As in Trello



### Generate config tool

- single file (variables de remplacements)
  - add hostings/cores
  - add DNS static data
  - Add remaining variables if any
- 
- web app OR
  - format check
  - nicer than editing JSON
  - what more can be done here?

- leader API to update config files
  - issues with replacing files
  - going towards no sysadmin (rest to reboot followers upon file changes)
    - there is still to do auto reboot
- Followers:
  - 

### 2. Migration procedure
