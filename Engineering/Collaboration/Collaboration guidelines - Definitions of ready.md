# Definitions of "ready"


## "Ready" for iterations

An iteration can start when the following conditions are met.

- Iteration contents are prioritized
- Iteration contents include all stories, bugfixes, and other work that the team is committing to
- No hidden work
- All team members have calculated their capacity (hours available) for the iteration
- All stories/bugfixes meet the definition of "ready" (see below)


## "Ready" for user stories (e.g. product features)

A candidate story or bugfix is considered "ready for implementation" when the following conditions are met (unless extended or redefined in a particular project).

- **Valuable**: who will benefit and what the benefit is set in the title (and if needed the description)
- **Independent**: valuable by itself (i.e. must not be a mere dependency of another item); if not, it's probably better expressed as a sub-task of another item
- **Estimated**: the necessary implementation effort is estimated (an absolute requirement for planning); if the collaboration tool used provides no dedicated way, the estimated effort points are prefixed within parentheses to the title (e.g. "(3) As a {user} I need {feature}...")
- **Dependencies known** and listed
- **Feasible within one iteration**: includes that no external dependencies prevent completion
- **Testable**: acceptance criteria must be clear (e.g. handling of alternate or error cases)
- **Validatable**: the person who will validate the work is identified

### Specific "ready" criteria for front-end stories

- **UX/UI included**: any UX/UI work necessary is fully taken into account
