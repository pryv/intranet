# General collaboration guidelines

## Base principles

- **Keep your work visible**: all current and planned work items must be visible as to-dos/cards in the collaboration tools (e.g. Basecamp, Trello)
- **Order items by priority**: work items to be done first are at the top of the lists
- **Stay focused**: keep track of what you committed to vs unplanned work and make sure you keep the right balance


## Development work

### Work items

Development work items are represented as cards (e.g. Trello).

- **Specify non-bug items as user stories**: *"As a {user type}, I need/want/would like {feature} [so that {value}]"*
  - Stick to the benefiting user's perspective and avoid implementation details
- **Plan the details just in time**: don't overplan and refrain from fleshing out too much detail until just before or at the time work starts
- **Break down item work as tasks in checklist(s)**: when appropriate, (@)mention the team mate who's in charge of the task
- **Keep the size down**: if you think an item will probably take more than a few days to implement, it probably needs to be split
  - Items that won't be implemented soon can (and should) stay higher level (they'll be split later) 
- **Don't write specifications**: work items usually should remain minimal, concise reminders of what's to implement
  - The full "specification" of a given item must be very clear but doesn't have to be written anywhere (verbal understanding is fine)
  - Only write down what actually helps you do the work.

### Lists (or columns)

Typical order, from left to right.

1. **Ready to implement**: "ready" items in the current batch of work or iteration
2. **Doing**: items currently being worked on
3. **Pending validation**: items whose implementation is waiting for validation from a peer 
4. **Done**: items completed in the current batch of work or iteration
5. **Milestone**: items planned for the next milestone
6. **Issue reports and feature requests, to review**: "inbox" of proposed items (feature requests, issue reports) waiting for validation and prioritization
7. **Refactoring/cleanup bag**: "refactoring / cleanup" items (corresponding to technical debt) that don't need to be done for a particular time but should be regularly included in iterations
8. **Later (backlog)**: items that may be done at some point later in time


### Assignments

To make it easy to see the pending/current dev work of any of us (e.g. "cards" view in Trello).

- Top-most "ready" items and all cards from "doing" to "done" must be assigned (reminder)
- Don't assign other items


### Grooming

- Archive "done" items once they've been reported to the team (e.g. in the weekly status meeting)
- Process "inbox" items regularly (e.g. once a week)
