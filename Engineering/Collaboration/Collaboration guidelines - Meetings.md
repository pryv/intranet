# Meetings

Quick reminders covering a few specific pain points; by no means comprehensive.

## Iteration review & planning

Meeting agenda is project-based (not person-based).

- **Prepare** what you're going to say (and how, e.g. demo) for each of your projects beforehand, notifying the team if you expect your presentation(s) to take longer than usual
- **Stand up** to speak to the other team members, who **keep their laptops and devices shut**
- **Contents, for each project**:
    1. **Remind others of what you committed to** at the last iteration start
    2. **Present what you did (and what you did not)**, using demos and explaining if relevant (e.g. unplanned work or issues encountered)
    3. **Present what's coming next** (overall priorities) for the next iteration(s)
- **Use the collaboration tools**: every reported or planned work item must be visible in the tools, and it is recommended that you use them as a guideline when presenting
- **Keep it short, factual and interesting**
    - Quick feedback from other members is fine, but any further discussion belongs in ad-hocs meetings
    - If it's not interesting to the whole team, either you should present differently or it belongs elsewhere
    

## Daily stand-ups

Meeting agenda is person-based.

- **No devices**
- **Stand up!**
- **Keep it factual; discussions belong elsewhere** (any discussion can wait for a few minutes until the standup completes)
- **Contents, for each participant**
    1. **What have I done** since the last standup I attended: You report to the team what you actually did of the plan you committed to at the previous standup. If you did more, less or something else than was planned, say it and briefly explain why.
    2. **What do I plan to do** until the next one: You commit in front of the team to a certain amount of work you plan to do.
    3. **What are the issues (if any)** slowing down/blocking my work (to be possibly discussed after the meeting)
