# GitHub-specific guidelines

## Issue labels

Keep labels the same across all our repositories by:

- Syncing them using [github-label-sync](https://github.com/Financial-Times/github-label-sync) and [those label definitions (github-labels.yml)](./github-labels.yml) (to be kept up-to-date)
- Making sure [our default repo settings](https://github.com/organizations/pryv/settings/repository-defaults) are up-to-date
