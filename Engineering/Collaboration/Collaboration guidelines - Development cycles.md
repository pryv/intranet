# Development cycle

## Each milestone

1. **Plan milestone**: pick features/tasks (or higher level themes), estimate (effort points, no days/hours)
	- *Output: milestone contents*
2. **Iterate**, reviewing progress & adjusting course as needed
3. **Review milestone if relevant**: present milestone outcome (demo) to larger audience (other stakeholders)
4. **Hold team retrospective if relevant**; team retrospectives can also be held at other times if appropriate
	- *Output: validated list of actions for improving collaboration*


## Each iteration

See also: [definitions of "ready"](Collaboration%20guidelines%20-%20Definitions%20of%20ready.md).

1. **Prerequisites**:
	- Planning contents (in collaboration tools) are up-to-date (including prioritization and rough estimates)
	- Each team member knows the time (number of hours) she'll be available for iteration work
1. **Review priorities** (whole-team meeting): project by project; each project team briefly presents current priorities to rest of team for validation
	- *Output: team-validated priorities*
2. **Plan iteration** (per-project team meeting): move top-priority items to iteration contents, estimate (hours)
	- *Output: iteration contents (could require further confirmation through ad-hoc design discussions), if needed: ad-hoc design discussions schedule*
3. **Discuss design if relevant** (ad-hoc, per-project team meetings): discuss & make decisions on product design (UX/UI/code/architecture/etc.) in order to implement contents of the present iteration or an upcoming iteration
	- *Output: validated design, possibly: confirmed iteration contents*
3. **Implement**: each project team implements iteration contents without external interference
	- Daily standup meetings (whole-team): each team member very briefly tells 1) what she's been doing for the project since the last standup meeting she attended, 2) what she plans to do until the next one, and 3) whether she's experiencing issues or impediments to her work.
	- *Output: product increment*
4. **Review iteration** (whole-team meeting): project by project; each project team presents the work done (demo) to the rest of the team
	- Prerequisite: each project team knows what to present and how
	- *Output: validated product increment*
5. Adjust milestone planning if appropriate
