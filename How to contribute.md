# How to contribute/fix content on this intranet

You can either…

- Edit content online within GitHub: just hit the 'Edit' button, do your change(s), and commit, choosing to create a new branch with a pull request (unless your edit is already part of one) – probably best for one-off edits from contributors who aren't regular maintainers;
- Check out the repo, create a new branch if needed, edit locally in your preferred editor (KB tools like Obsidian work well), commit and push (in a PR).

In order to ensure quality:

- As for all documentation, wear your 'newcomer' (or 'future self') lenses to ensure content is as clear and complete as possible, and can be found where it belongs.
- Minimise unresolved links as well as unlinked pages. Various tools can check those (e.g. Obsidian plugin 'Find unlinked files and unresolved links').
- See our basic [content writing guidelines (Markdown)](Engineering/Content%20(e.g.%20documentation)/Content%20writing%20guidelines%20-%20Markdown.md)
